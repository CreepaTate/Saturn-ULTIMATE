# Saturn: Moon Edition

- *Saturn: Moon Edition* is a fork of [Undervolt/Moon64](https://github.com/Undervolt/Moon64) with machinima features.
- In order to use or compile the editor, a prior copy of the game is required. This is to avoid including any copyrighted material.

#### Features

```
- Completely revamped UI with dockable panels
- Machinima camera
  - A "free camera", can be frozen in place or moved with the joystick.
- Custom eye textures
  - Loaded externally as PNG files
  - Can be selected through a dropdown
- Color code editor
  - Uses the common *GameShark* format
  - Complete visual CC editor
  - Color presets save as a .gs file for later use
- Toggles for HUD, Mario's cap emblem, overall buttons, voices, head rotations, shadows, dust particles and more
- Switch between cap states (on/off/wing) and hand poses (victory/open/holding hat/etc.)
- Custom textures (& texture packs) support
  - All textures are 100% customizable
- Settings manager
  - All options from sm64ex and Moon64 (minus configuring controls, currently) carry over to the new UI
  - Option to disable music and Mario's voice for machinima purposes
- "Anti-aliasing" (not really, just clever internal resolution scaling, works better with cross-platform)
- "Jabo Mode", a toggle to recreate the infamous weird widescreen stretching, as seen in many Project64 graphics plugins.
```

*... And more to come!*
