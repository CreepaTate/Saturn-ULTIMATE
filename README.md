# Saturn (dev)

- Saturn (dev) is a fork of [Undervolt/Moon64](https://github.com/Undervolt/Moon64) with machinima features.
- In order to compile the editor, a prior copy of the game is required. This is to avoid including any copyrighted material.

#### Features

- Freeze camera, works in any level
- Color code editor
  - Uses the common *GameShark* format
- Changeable eye/hand/cap states
- Custom textures (& texture packs) support
  - All textures, including those used in the eye states, are 100% customizable
- Settings manager
- Completely revamped UI with dockable panels
