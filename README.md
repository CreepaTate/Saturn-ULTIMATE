# Saturn

- Saturn *(legacy)* is a fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex) designed for machinima.
- In order to compile the editor, a prior copy of the game is required. This is to avoid including any copyrighted material.
- Looking for **Saturn: Moon Edition**? Check the [moon](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn/tree/moon) branch.
